## Central Theme

The Co-evolution of Surveillance and Capitalism
Throughout history, a desire for efficiency has driven the automation of labor, whether through the division of tasks into menial units or through the actual supplanting of humans by machines. Either case makes clear that to imagine that labor can be automated is to imagine laborers as at least somewhat mechanical. This characterization is inherently dehumanizing and reductive: only the mechanical parts of laborers are useful, and their humanity is considered a mere inconvenience. In fact, it’s most expedient to describe laborers as black boxes, such that they can be quantified only by their explicit interactions with the system.

Of course, even those most infatuated with the dreams of automation recognize that people are not truly black boxes. Nevertheless, the ‘master capitalists’ – those in charge of the automaton – imagine that some parts of human behavior can be treated as such; by giving people certain inputs (reward, punishment), they can expect certain outputs. Thus, in an effort to “nudge” people toward desired, more mechanical behaviors, the master capitalist imposes practices of surveillance upon their subjects. Conveniently, the rationalized, automated workplace lends itself easily to these practices. To describe a laborer as a black box is to render their work (and hence their entire value) easily measurable and therefore easily surveilled.

The paradigm of surveillance capitalism introduced by Zuboff suggests that the “Big Brother”-esque practices of automated labor have engulfed society as a whole. The marketplace of personal data commodifies people and treats them as controllable, given enough data. Surveillance capitalists propose that the more precise and accurate their data, the greater control they have over their ‘users.’ Personal data becomes both the means of surveillance and a form of currency; therein lies the novelty of big technology companies’ business models. The value they extract from their users isn’t in the form of labor – instead, they sustain themselves on identities, bought and sold in ‘behavioral futures markets.’

#### Amazon. “Amazon Privacy Policy for Vehicle Camera Technology,” in Vincent, James. 2021. “Amazon Delivery Drivers Have to Consent to AI Surveillance in Their Vans or Lose Their Jobs.” The Verge. March 24, 2021. Available at: <https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form.> [Accessed 7 April 2022]. 

This privacy policy, which every Amazon delivery driver was required to sign, gives consent for Amazon to conduct surveillance on drivers within Amazon delivery vehicles. This includes information such as video recording, biometric information, and real-time GPS information. The uses for this information are particularly relevant to our exhibit. For example, Amazon states that it may use the information collected to “improve the accuracy of mapping, routing and navigation data,” which directly makes Amazon’s workers more efficient. Furthermore, we will argue that the surveillance of its drivers in this way acts as an automated way of exerting soft control over driver behavior.


#### Friedmann, G., 2022. Anatomy of work: labor, leisure, and the implications of automation : Friedmann, Georges : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive. [online] Internet Archive. Available at: <https://archive.org/details/anatomyofworklab00frie/page/n21/mode/2up> [Accessed 7 April 2022].

Friedmann addresses various questions raised regarding human labor and development, particularly in regards to the introduction of automation into the workplace. He comments on recent trends in production methods and argues that the introduction of electronic devices and other automated devices will have a profound impact on workers’ relationship with the interest in their jobs. This salient argument Friedmann makes supports the central thesis of our website because we are positing that the creation and introduction of automation technologies have revolutionized how people behave at work and the relationship they have with their jobs. 


#### Kalischko, T. and Riedl, R., 2021. Electronic Performance Monitoring in the Digital Workplace: Conceptualization, Review of Effects and Moderators, and Future Research Opportunities. Frontiers in Psychology, 12.

This research article illuminates the drastic impacts the rise of digital technologies have had on workplaces, accelerated further by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kailschko and Riedl outline both the benefits and the detriments of increased surveillance technology. The authors introduce the concept of “Electronic Performance Monitoring” which refers to the now common use of technology to observe, record and analyze information that both directly and indirectly relates to job performance. The authors’ argument is that this advancement of technology is a paradigm shift that has enabled organizations to monitor employees extremely closely, and with greater intensity than was ever possible before. This research article brings up many key arguments that support our website’s theme because we claim that increased automation makes it easier than ever for people to be even more alienated from their work – thus resulting in increased job dissatisfaction) because their work doesn’t belong to them but rather than organization watching. 


#### Karl Marx, “The Factory” in Capital, Vol. 1, Ch. 15, Section 4.

“The Factory” is an excerpt from Chapter 15: Machinery and Modern Industry of Volume 1 of Das Kapital. Marx shows how the importance and value of human labor has been exponentially decaying since the industrial revolution, even though this labor is crucial to the functioning of society. Marx further argues that factory work, with the introduction of the automaton as an “autocrat” actually “exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost” (para 8). His assertions are central to the website’s theme because we argue that the integration of automation into workplaces not only alienates people from their labor, but provides the managerial entities the ability to shape how the workers behave via monitoring the levels of efficiency they achieve.  


#### Sperber, J., 2014. Yelp and Labor Discipline. New Labor Forum, 23(2), pp.68-74.

Sperber explores the effect of Yelp and similar review sites as a mechanism of turning customers into “unpaid managers” (69). In this way, Yelp automates the ability for customers to conduct surveillance on restaurant workers, which the authors argue results in increased worker exploitation by encouraging restaurant owners to increase worker productivity. This secondary source presents two distinct views on the automation of surveillance: first, humans, not AI, are conducting the surveillance; second, the employers themselves are only indirectly involved in conducting the surveillance. This source also argues for the relationship between surveillance and labor extraction, which is a primary connection we seek to explore in our exhibit.
